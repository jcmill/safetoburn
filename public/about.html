      <h1>About Safe To Burn </h1>
      <p>Safe to Burn was started because one fall, the city I lived in decided to remove their curbside leaf collection. With a single yard waste can and nearly a half acre of leaves to manage, I had to confirm that burning was allowed in my county and research which weather conditions were safe. I realized there should be an easier way to find all this information. That’s why I built Safe to Burn. This is version one of the site, and I plan to add features like real-time air quality data (AQI) and a county-by-county guide to acceptable burn materials.</p>
      <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
      <p>While this site helps you understand current conditions, you are still responsible for burning safely and legally. That means:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li><b>Check for permits or burn bans.</b> Local rules vary by county and state. Always confirm what’s required where you live.</li>
        <li><b>Never leave a fire unattended.</b> Even safe conditions can change quickly.</li>
        <li><b>Keep safety equipment nearby.</b> Have water, a hose, or an extinguisher ready.</li>
        <li><b>Be mindful of neighbors and air quality.</b> Smoke travels farther than you think.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This site is a <b>guide, not a guarantee</b>. Use it to inform your decision, but always follow local laws and common-sense fire safety practices.</p>
      <h2>Who Built This</h2>
      <p>This site was created by <a href="https://jakemillerdev.com/">Jake Miller</a>, a developer who enjoys building tools that make simple and information accessible.
