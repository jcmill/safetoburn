# Is It Safe to Burn Today?

A fire safety conditions app meant to track wind speed, humidity, and burn bans at your location.

## What is the Safe to Burn app?

Safe to Burn is meant to help homeowners, farmers, and land managers quickly check if weather and environmental conditions are safe for burning brush or debris. By combining local weather data, wind speeds, humidity levels, and official fire alerts, we provide a simple, reliable tool for making responsible burning decisions. Enter your city, state, or ZIP code to see real-time wind speed, humidity, and active burn bans in your area.

## FAQ

### How does this website determine if it’s safe to burn?

We combine data from weather services and local fire alerts to evaluate wind speed, humidity, and burn bans in your area.

### How often is the burn safety information updated?

Our data refreshes automatically every hour (or more frequently during severe weather) to provide as close to real-time conditions as possible.

### Does this site cover burn bans issued by my local authorities?

Yes. Whenever available, we pull official burn ban notices from county or state agencies and display them alongside weather conditions.

### What weather conditions make burning unsafe?

High winds, low humidity, and poor air quality increase fire risk and health hazards. We flag any of these conditions and alerts as “unsafe to burn.”

### Can I rely solely on this website to decide whether to burn?

We recommend using our site as a guide, but you should also check local regulations and advisories, since burn rules can vary by county or municipality.

## About Safe To Burn

Safe to Burn was started because one fall, the city I lived in decided to remove their curbside leaf collection. With a single yard waste can and nearly a half acre of leaves to manage, I had to confirm that burning was allowed in my county and research which weather conditions were safe. I realized there should be an easier way to find all this information. That’s why I built Safe to Burn. This is version one of the site, and I plan to add features like real-time air quality data (AQI) and a county-by-county guide to acceptable burn materials.

### Your Responsibility

While this site helps you understand current conditions, you are still responsible for burning safely and legally. That means:

- Check for permits or burn bans. Local rules vary by county and state. Always confirm what’s required where you live.
- Never leave a fire unattended. Even safe conditions can change quickly.
- Keep safety equipment nearby. Have water, a hose, or an extinguisher ready.
- Be mindful of neighbors and air quality. Smoke travels farther than you think.

This site is a guide, not a guarantee. Use it to inform your decision, but always follow local laws and common-sense fire safety practices.
