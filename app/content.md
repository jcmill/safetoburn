# Is It Safe to Burn Today?

A fire-safety conditions tool that helps you understand whether the weather and local regulations make it safe to burn brush, yard waste, or vegetation where you live.

Checking before you burn reduces wildfire risk, protects air quality, and helps keep your community safe.

## What is the _Safe to Burn_ app?

Safe to Burn is designed for homeowners, farmers, land owners, and land managers who need a quick and reliable way to check whether outdoor burning is safe and permitted.

Instead of searching multiple websites for weather forecasts, burn bans, and alerts, this app brings together:

- Wind speed and direction
- Humidity levels
- Fire danger alerts
- Local burn bans and restrictions
- Seasonal or temporary safety advisories

Enter your city, ZIP code, or other location to see real-time burn conditions.

**If conditions are unsafe, we’ll tell you. If burning is restricted, we’ll tell you.**

Burning responsibly protects your property, your neighbors, and the environment.

## How We Determine Burn Safety Conditions

Outdoor burning is most affected by three key weather and environmental factors:

| Factor          | Why It Matters                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wind Speed      | Wind spreads embers, flame, and smoke. High wind = high fire risk.   |
| Humidity        | Low humidity dries out vegetation, making it extremely flammable.    |
| Local Burn Bans | Issued by counties to prevent wildfires during dangerous conditions. |

We collect data from **National Weather Service, local fire agencies,** and **environmental authorities** to provide simple guidance:

- Safe to Burn
- Use Caution
- Not Safe to Burn
- Burning Prohibited Due to Local Ban

This information updates automatically throughout the day.

### When _Not_ to Burn

Outdoor burning should be avoided when:

- Winds are above 10–15 mph
- Humidity is below 25–35%
- Your county has issued a burn ban
- Air quality is unhealthy
- Conditions are extremely dry or your area is under drought alerts

A small, controlled burn can turn dangerous faster than most people realize.

## About Safe To Burn

This project began when I needed to clear a large amount of leaf and brush waste, and realized how difficult it was to find reliable information about whether burning was both legal and safe. I wanted a tool that was simple, accurate, and easy to understand.
